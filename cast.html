            <h3>Ted Mosby</h3>
            <span class="actor-name">Josh Radnor</span>
            <p>An architect, college professor and the central character of the series. He is the
                main protagonist where he tells the story of his adult years from his late twenties
                to his early thirties and about all his obstacles he has to endure before he meets
                "The One" aka the Mother. This story is told by the Older Ted Mosby, and narrator of
                the series, Bob Saget. Ted moved to New York City with his friends Marshall and Lily
                after graduating from Wesleyan University. In New York, he met Barney at the urinal
                of MacLaren's and Robin, to whom he was immediately attracted. Ted is on a quest for
                happiness and "The One", the woman he will marry. Ted prefers more elegant and
                high-class interests than his friends have. He goes to great lengths to profess his
                love to the women in his life, but they all falter eventually. Despite these
                qualities, Ted often acts immaturely, such as partaking in wild activities with
                Barney. In the showâ€™s finale, he says, that, in Tracy, he had met the love of his
                life (the titular Mother), but only after he was finished telling the story he
                realized that Robin was the love of his life.</p>

            <h3>Barney Stinson</h3>
            <span class="actor-name">Neil Patrick Harris</span>
            <p>A serial playboy, using his relative wealth and an array of outrageous strategies to
                seduce women with no intention of engaging in a relationship. His catchphrases
                include 'Suit Up' and 'Legend-wait-for-it-Dary'. He is Ted's "bro," often jealous of
                Marshall for having known Ted since college. Abandoned by his father at a young age,
                Barney has abandonment issues and clings to his friends. He marries Robin in the
                series finale but they divorce after three years. In 2020, a failed one-night stand
                gives him a daughter, Ellie. Neil's husband David Burtka has appeared on 7 episodes
                on the show as Scooter.</p>

            <h3>Robin Scherbatsky</h3>
            <span class="actor-name">Cobie Smulders</span>
            <p>A news anchor who has on-again off-again relationships with both Ted and Barney.
                Robin emigrated from Canada to take a job in a news station and met Ted at
                MacLaren's; her Canadian background is a source of many jokes from her friends. She
                is shown to be very career-centric and rejects traditional roles, such as getting
                married and having kids. Robin often drinks scotch and smokes cigars, and she is an
                avid gun fan. She and Barney get engaged and later marry in the first part of the
                series finale, but divorce in the second part, three years later. Cobie's husband
                Taran Kilam has also appeared on 6 episodes of the show as Gary Blauman.</p>

            <span class="actor-name">Alyson Hannigan</span>
            <p>A kindergarten teacher, aspiring artist, and Marshall's wife. She is terrible at
                keeping secrets, and can be manipulative at times. She marries Marshall in season 2
                and gives birth to Marvin in season 7. Though appearing sweet and cute, Lily can be
                quite unexpectedly fierce. Alyson's husband Alexis Denisof has appeared on 10
                episodes on the show as Sandy Rivers.</p>

            <span class="actor-name">Jason Segel</span>
            <p>Ted's best friend. In season 2 Marshall marries Lily, with whom he has been in love
                since his freshman year of college; they have a child during season 7. Marshall was
                born in St. Cloud, Minnesota. He has an interest in paranormal phenomenon, and
                mythical creatures, particularly Sasquatch. His dream to be an environmental lawyer
                conflicts with his immediate need for money, such as for his wedding and to raise
                his children.</p>
